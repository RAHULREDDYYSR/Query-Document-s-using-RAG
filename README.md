# Query-Document-s-using-RAG
This project showcases a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to query documents like PDFs using a combination of Large Language Models (LLMs) and various embedding models. Users can upload a PDF file, ask natural language questions, and get accurate, context-aware responses sourced directly from the uploaded document.
